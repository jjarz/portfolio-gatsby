My overarching goal is to spark intrinsic motivation and curiosity in my students. I use hands-on projects and real-world examples in my teaching and involve students in curriculum development to create engaging course content.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">I used project-based learning for the majority of my teaching at American YouthWorks (AYW) YouthBuild vocational training program. I facilitated a program where students learned about computer hardware by refurbishing computers in a partnership with the City of Austin’s Digital Inclusion program. My students also learned about project management and graphic design by completing screen-printing projects for non-profit clients. By troubleshooting issues that arose in these projects, students learned to solve the kinds of setbacks that inevitably arise in creative problem-solving situations. Students also cultivated ownership and a sense of craftsmanship over their work through these projects. I aim to instill this in the college students I teach now, who learn to apply documentation to their own needs and master debugging strategies. As a TA for CU Boulder’s Fundamentals of Human-Computer Interaction and Introduction to Computational Thinking courses, I push students to consider not just whether their code solves a problem, but also the projects’ accessibility, usability and ethical implications.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Another method I use to motivate students is connecting course content to their lives</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">outside of class. One of the exciting things about my subject areas of design and computer science is that they can be applied to such a wide variety of disciplines. I encourage students to integrate their own interests into what they’re learning in class, creating assignments that are flexible enough for students to have freedom to do so. For example, I gave students the option to choose their own graphic design project in my AYW class. One student designed a logo and artwork for a fantasy card game she had created in her free time. Another designed skins for her favorite video game. I also integrate real-world problems into content to be relevant to students. I developed a programming assignment in which students create a content moderation system for a social media platform, compelling them to practice technical skills like file input/output, keyword matching with regular expressions, and functions, as well as reflect on how their system design affects users and consider how social media platforms they use deal with similar challenges.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">I get to know students, in order to better understand how to make content relevant for</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">them. On the first day of the lab I teach for CU Boulder’s Introduction of Computational Thinking course, I asked students to develop an algorithm to sort themselves into groups based on their majors and why they are taking the class. The exercise got students to share a bit about their motivations and personality with me and the rest of the class, as they created the algorithm and analyzed its efficiency as a team. In the spirit of inclusive design, I find ways to “design with, not for” when creating lessons and assignments. In my research, I evaluate and brainstorm curriculum through focus groups with students. Based on their feedback, I supplemented lecture slides and clarified the assignment instructions for areas that students identified as challenging. I also generated</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">a bank of assignment ideas from these focus groups, collaborating with students to formulate ideas around tech controversies they feel affected by.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Activities like developing and acting out an algorithm as a group build a supportive learning environment, another key element of my teaching philosophy. I translate community building activities I used while teaching at American YouthWorks to the college environment, where students need to feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions in order to learn. I take simple actions to build relationships, like asking students to share something good from their week in the wait time before class starts. I also contribute to more involved efforts to support students, like using a restorative approach to resolving conflict, talking through issues rather than resorting to punitive measures.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">I treat teaching as a craft that I continuously improve. To formally hone my skills, I participate in workshops run by CU Boulder’s Center for Teaching &amp; Learning, am completing the university’s Certificate for College Teaching, and journal about my class objectives and outcomes before and after labs. I speak with students about how class is going in person, which creates a dialogue so I can ask for clarifications on their feedback, and gives me a chance to improve my practices before I receive formal mid or end-of-semester evaluations. Because I build relationships with my students, they are comfortable telling me how I can improve when I ask them for feedback. I also take into account feedback I have received from fellow teachers. I co-taught some of my class at AYW and regularly discussed improvements with my co-teacher, and have reviewed</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">video-recordings of my recitations at CU with the lead TA. The work I put into my teaching pays off. Through teaching, I learn new ways of thinking, expand my own skills and gain a broader and clearer picture of the subject by explaining it to a variety of learners.</p></body></html>
